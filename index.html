            <p class="textthree text-center">"The Three Little Pigs" is a fable about three pigs who build their houses of different materials. 
              A Big Bad Wolf blows down the first two pigs' houses which are made of straw and sticks respectively, 
              but is unable to destroy the third pig's house that is made of bricks. </p>

            <p class="caption text-center">Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and 
              not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.</p>

            <p class="caption text-center">The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, 
              and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.</p>

      <h1 class="text-center">So he knocked on the door and said: </h1>

          Little pig! Little pig! <br>Let me in! Let me in!
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-center">But the little pig saw the wolf's big paws, so he answered back: </h1>

          No! No! No! <br>Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!

        The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; 
        and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about 
        the fine dinner they would make.

      <p class="textthree text-center">Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, 
        he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore.</p>

              and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. 
              The wolf was very angry and getting even bigger and even badder by the minute.</p>

              fell down in the blazing fire.

              The last the three little pigs saw of the big bad wolf was him flying over the treetops clutching a very sore tail.
